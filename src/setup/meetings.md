# Meetings

Meetings are completely under the jurisdiction of managers with regard to their frequency, length, agenda etc.

You are expected to attend every meeting unless otherwise clarified. 

If unable to attend a meeting, let your manager know ASAP.

All meeting minutes are kept on Notion.

Consult your portfolio manager for further clarification/questions.
