# Expectations
The following are probation requirements for new members in their respective teams:

## AI Outreach
1. Read the entirety of the education training booklet
2. Program a simple deep learning model & explain your program theoretically
3. Program a parallel loop in C & explain your code theoretically

As educators of AI, we expect our members to be technically competent enough to be able to understand and apply the content they are teaching. 

We ought to know what weâ€™re talking about ðŸ”¥

By meeting the 3 requirements as outlined above, there will be virtually no question or task as an Education team member that you will be incapable of dealing with.

Donâ€™t stress if you have no clue how to achieve those tasks ðŸ’¯.

You will receive specialised trained by your manager/s to achieve these tasks, alongside accompanying resources.
