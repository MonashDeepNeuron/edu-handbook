# Location

Your room can have a major impact on the success of the workshop.

Generally, aim to have an open space where there are tables set up for people to collaborate in tables- this is particularly helpful for activities. 

Ensure it is an area with minimal distraction or potential for a disruption during your workshop.

Try to vet the room if possible before confirming/booking.
