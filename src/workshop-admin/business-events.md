# Business/Events

You must decide how you wish to engage the Business team once event planning begins.

## Venue Booking

If you need a specific space on campus, such as a seminar room or lecture theatre, the Business can help with identifying and booking an appropriate venue. Provide them with the event date, time, expected number of attendees, and any technical requirements.

## Catering and Refreshments

For larger or more formal events (e.g., panel discussions or industry networking), you may want to provide catering. Business can assist with:

- Sourcing affordable catering options
- Organising dietary requirements
- Managing delivery or pick-up logistics on the day

## Budget and Invoicing

If you require funding support or need to cover expenses for things like printing, catering, or decorations, Business can guide you through the process of submitting a budget request and handling reimbursements or payments.
