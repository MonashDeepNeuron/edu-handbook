# Marketing

You must decide how you wish to market the event once it's been confirmed. 
## High School Workshops
Generally you will be presenting to a class that is 'forced' to be present in a classroom.

If however, it has voluntary attendance, ensure you get the teacher contact to publish the event on relevant messaging platforms to students at several intervals leading up to the event.

## University Workshops

MDN has a [dedicated marketing team](https://www.deepneuron.org/marketing) to manage marketing for events.

Reach out to them to set up posts etc. 

How to market the event is beyond the scope of this booklet.
