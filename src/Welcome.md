# Welcome

Welcome and congratulations on joining the MDN Education team. 

This is the Education Training Book which contains the training material which covers much of the prerequisite content necessary to deliver workshops or provide education as part of MDN.

Throughout this book you will learn the philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of education at MDN, alongside the specific tools and strategies we use. 

Have fun ðŸ˜‹

## What is Education at Monash DeepNeuron?

The Education Branch in MDN aims to raise awareness and generate excitement within young minds so that they may establish a more informed insight into the world of DL and HPC.

This can involve things such as running workshops, holding events, crafting resources and creating content. 

Within Education, you'll learn how to clearly articulate technical concepts relating to AI and HPC, alongside the tangential skills necessary to do so in an engaging, exciting way.


## Education Training

### What is all this and what is it for?

This is a book. More specifically it is the book containing all the content, training resources and learning materials that you will be using to complete your Edu training. 

The purpose of this book is to provide clear and concise learning resources that you can utilise effectively; not just in your role at Education, but for the entirety of your time at Monash DeepNeuron and beyond.

### What are you going to learn?

During your Education training, you are going to learn key Education concepts and various tools that exist that allow us to conduct our operations as Education at MDN.

You will begin by learning about the philosophy behind our educational approach at MDN.

From here, you will go through the setup process for MDN Edu members, covering admin, expectations the subsequent induction procedures.

You'll then jump into the concepts involved in an MDN workshop- from the theory to the tactical frameworks. 

Lastly, you'll learn how to effectively utilise key technologies used for our presentations, events and resources, such as PowerPoint and Google Colab. 

### How to use this book

The structure of this booklet has been developed to allow you to learn at your own pace.

The content is split up into chapters which covers a particular topic which can be further broken down sections. 

You navigate through the book mostly chronologically using the arrow buttons on either side of the page (can't miss them). 

You can also look through the chapters and sections to find particular topics or using the search bar, which can be activated by typing <kbd>S</kbd>.



<!-- Potentially add challenges later on???
