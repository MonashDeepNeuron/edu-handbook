# Journey Framework

Putting the theory in practice from the previous sections, we now have a structured framework we can use when planning our workshops:

<figure>
  <img src="./images/jf1.png" alt="Audience">
  <figcaption>Journey Framework Template.</figcaption>
</figure>

Use this when planning for workshops.

It follows a simple input, processes, output structure.

Here is an example of one filled out:

<figure>
  <img src="./images/EXAMPLE.png" alt="Journey Framework Example">
  <figcaption>Notice that the middle column contains ACTIONS we take during the workshop to achieve the transformation</figcaption>
</figure>
