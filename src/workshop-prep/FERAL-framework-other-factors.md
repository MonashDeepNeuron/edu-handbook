# Other Key Factors

We stuck with FERAL because, let’s be honest, it sounds cool. 😎 But there are a few other things that can make or break a workshop – so keep these in mind too:

### 🛠️ Practicality (Make it useful!)

✅ Are attendees walking away with real-world skills or knowledge they can use?  
✅ Can they apply what they've learned outside of this session?

### 🕒 Planning & Timing (Respect the clock!)

✅ Is the workshop well-paced (not a rushed info dump, but also not dragging)?  
✅ Is there buffer time for questions, discussions, and unexpected detours?  
✅ Is there a backup plan in case something happens on the day?

### 🎤 Delivery & Energy (Nobody likes a monotone robot!)

✅ Are we keeping the energy high and making the session engaging?  
✅ Are presenters interactive and dynamic, not just reading slides in a monotone?

Because at the end of the day, a great workshop isn’t just about the content – it’s about how it’s delivered. 🚀🔥
