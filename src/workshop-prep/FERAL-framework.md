# FERAL Framework

Workshops at MDN aren’t just “sit-and-listen” sessions – we make them **interactive, engaging, and actually worth attending**. That’s where **FERAL** comes in.  
No, it’s not about going absolutely wild _(although, sometimes that happens hehe 😉)._

It’s about creating workshops that:  
✅ **Flow** seamlessly  
✅ **Engagement** with participants  
✅ **Relatablity** to real-life concepts  
✅ **Aesthetically** beautiful  
✅ **Legacy** create

And why do we do it? Because **education is more than just delivering information** – it’s about making an impact.

As **your Education Leads**, here’s what drives us:

    <p>💬 <em>"One of the major highlights of teaching is witnessing that 'Aha!' moment on a student’s face. It’s absolutely priceless to see someone transition from confusion to understanding – from ‘what on earth is this?’ to ‘I actually get it now.’ That’s exactly why I teach, and I know it resonates with many of us in this profession."</em></p>

This is why **FERAL** exists – it’s our way of ensuring that every MDN workshop is an **experience**, not just a lecture.

In our personal experience of curating workshops at MDN, we have distilled these **5 key criteria points** that outline what makes our workshops so great 🔥.
