# FERAL Framework

Now that we have the idea behind what our workshop should achieve, let's narrow down on how we're going to curate our content to get there.

Through all our experience, we've distilled what we believe are the 5 key points which underpin a great workshop.

# Make your workshops FERAL

## **Flow**

Each section of the workshop leads into the following sections smoothly; the workshop follows the patterns of a narrative.

Don't think about the workshop as separate parts you join together, think about it as a narrative/story, which you fill in.

## Engagement

As a rule of thumb:
> At least 1/3 of the entire workshop should be purely practical activities

There are obviously exceptions, but generally, 1:2 ratio between listening and action should occur.

We want participants to be actively engaged during these activities.

## Relatability

As a rule of thumb:
> Each and every new idea displayed in your workshop is associated with either an analogy, relatable example, or media reference

No exceptions.

## Aesthetic

This is what really separates us from the pack.

Later on in the booklet, there is greater detail with regards to how specifically we achieve this. 

Here are the guiding principles:

Each and every slide follows the same design language, as referenced by a design guidelines document.

At MDN, you use the MDN Branding kit.

## **Legacy**

Under the guise of the 4 aforementioned principles, students are left impressed and imprinted of the workshop; make this workshop one not worth forgetting.
