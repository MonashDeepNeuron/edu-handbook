# Securing the Workshop

Now that you have secured the workshop we have to make sure that things run smoothly.

## Make Sure To:

âœ… **Confirm the details ASAP** â€“ Once a school shows interest, **lock in the key details quickly** to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.

ðŸ§¾ **Confirm:**

- **Date & Time** â€“ Make sure it doesnâ€™t clash with exams or major school events.
- **Duration** â€“ Some schools might only allow a short session, so be flexible with time.
- **Year Level & Subject** â€“ Tailor the workshop depth to the studentsâ€™ background knowledge.
- **In-Person or Online?** â€“ If in-person, confirm logistics. If online, ensure a stable platform (Zoom, Teams, etc.).
- **Number of Students?** â€“ Helps us plan interaction levels and workshop activities.

âœ… **Set expectations early** â€“ Teachers want to know exactly what their students will get from this. Give them a short breakdown of what the workshop will cover and how it aligns with their curriculum.

<p></p>

âœ… **Send a confirmation email** â€“ Once details are agreed upon, send a follow-up email with:

- **A short workshop summary** (so teachers can brief students).
- **Any resources students need beforehand** (if applicable).
- **A point of contact** for last-minute questions.

<p></p>

âœ… **Check school rules & tech setup** â€“ Some schools restrict external software or have firewall issues that could block demos. This has happened in the past a few times with our workshops! Clarify tech requirements in advance to avoid last-minute disasters.

<p></p>

âœ… **Arrive early (or log in early for online workshops)** â€“ Give yourself time to set up, test tech, and settle in. Nothing kills energy like rushing through setup.
