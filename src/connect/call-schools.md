# How to Calls Schools Effectively

Calling a school can feel intimidating, but it’s **the fastest way to get a direct answer** – whether it’s a yes, no, or _“Send us an email instead.”_  
Unlike emails, which can sit unread for days, a call **gets immediate attention** and shows initiative.

The key? **Be confident, clear, and engaging.**  
You’re not a telemarketer or someone trying to sell a scam – you're offering something **valuable, exciting, and free**.  
Schools will appreciate the opportunity **if you present it well**.

## Tips to Secure the Dub:

✅ **Start strong** – Hook them with something interesting instead of a generic _“Hi, I’m calling about AI workshops.”_

✅ **Get to the point quickly** – Teachers and staff are busy; they don’t need a long intro.

✅ **Ask for the right person** – Receptionists won’t make decisions, so always ask who handles guest workshops or AI/STEM programs.

✅ **Be flexible & easy to work with** – Let them know we offer both in-person and online options to fit their schedule.

✅ **Expect redirections** – You’ll often be transferred, asked to email, or told they’ll get back to you – stay persistent and don’t give up easily.

✅ **Follow up immediately** – If they ask for an email, **send it right after the call** while they still remember you. Don’t delay it!
