# Best Follow Up Practices

Reaching out is just the first step – **following up is where the real progress happens.**  
Schools are busy, and emails often get buried under a mountain of admin work. A lack of response doesn’t mean they’re not interested – it just means we need to remind them (**politely but persistently**).

At the same time, **tracking our outreach efforts** is crucial.  
If we’re not organized, we could end up **emailing the same school multiple times** or missing out on opportunities simply because no one followed up.

To keep everything organised and professional, we track all outreach efforts in a Notion page – so ensure that you have created one with your team.

## Tips to Stay on Top:

✅ **Always follow up** – If you don’t get a response, don’t assume it’s a no.  
Schools take time to process external opportunities, and a quick reminder email can make all the difference.

✅ **Wait 3–5 days after the initial email** – If they haven’t replied, send a friendly nudge.  
(Example: _“Just following up on my last email to see if this would be of interest to your students.”_)

✅ **After one week, send a second follow-up** – If there’s still no response, send a slightly more direct follow-up.  
Keep it short, polite, and make it easy for them to respond.

✅ **If there’s still no response after two weeks, move on** – Some schools just won’t be interested, and that’s okay.  
Mark them as unresponsive and focus on other leads.

✅ **Use multiple contact methods** – If you originally emailed, try a phone call for the follow-up.  
Some staff members respond better to calls than emails.

✅ **Keep it casual, not pushy** – We’re not selling a product—we’re offering a valuable opportunity for students.  
Like you guys know how good our workshops are. The tone should always be polite, professional, and positive.
