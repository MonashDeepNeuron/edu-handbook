# How to Email Schools Effectively

Emailing schools isnâ€™t just about firing off a generic message and hoping for the best.  
**Teachers and school staff get flooded with emails daily**, so the key is to **stand out while keeping it professional and concise**.

## ðŸ”¥ Best Practices for Emailing Schools:

âœ… **Start with something attentionâ€“grabbing** â€“ The first thing they read should make them want to keep reading. This could be:

- **A GIF or sneak peek of our slides** to instantly catch their eye
- **A direct connection to their schoolâ€™s curriculum**  
  _("We noticed your school has a strong IT/Legal Studies programâ€”this would be a great fit.")_

âœ… **Keep it concise and direct** â€“ Teachers are busy. A long-winded, boring email will get ignored. Get to the point quickly.

âœ… **Make it easy for them** â€“ Schools wonâ€™t commit if they feel like itâ€™s a hassle. Offer flexible dates, emphasize that the workshop is free, and let them know they can choose between online or in-person.

âœ… **Include visuals when possible** â€“ Attaching a workshop poster or a sample slide makes it instantly more engaging than just a wall of text.

âœ… **Reassure them â€“ show weâ€™re legit** â€“ Schools want to know theyâ€™re not wasting time. Mention our past successful workshops and the schools weâ€™ve already worked with to build trust.

âœ… **Offer a meeting** â€“ If theyâ€™re interested but not fully convinced, suggest a quick Zoom or in-person chat to go over the details and answer any questions.

âœ… **Follow up, always** â€“ Most schools wonâ€™t respond to the first email. That doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re not interestedâ€”theyâ€™re just busy. Following up politely but persistently increases your chances of getting a reply.
