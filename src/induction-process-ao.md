# Induction Process: Law & Ethics Awareness and Outreach (AO) Member

Below outlines the steps new members must follow to become fully onboarded into the Awareness and Outreach (AO) subcommittee.

## Phase 1: Welcome and Introduction

### 1. Add to AO Subcommittee Group Chat

- Invite the new member to the generic AO group chat.
- Encourage them to introduce themselves and seek their expression of interest for current AO projects.
- Based on their interests, invite them to relevant project-specific group chats.

### 2. Overview of Role and Expectations

- Provide a brief overview of the AO subcommitteeâ€™s goals: increasing awareness of ethical and legal issues in tech through outreach and creative engagement.
- Set clear expectations around contribution, communication, and accountability.

### 3. Required Reading: Ethical Principles of AI Use

New members must read and understand the following core principles. These readings will be provided by the **Awareness and Outreach Manager**:

- **Accountability**: Understanding who is responsible for the decisions made by AI systems.
- **Bias**: Identifying how bias can manifest in data and algorithms, and methods of mitigation.
- **Privacy**: Grasping the importance of protecting user data and complying with regulations like GDPR.

## Phase 2: Training and Skills Assessment

### 1. Attend AO Standard Showcase Session

- Attend a 1-hour session run by senior AO members, featuring a walk-through of a prior workshop.
- This session will highlight the standards of quality expected in terms of content delivery, technical accuracy, design, and creativity.
- Introduction to essential tools commonly used in AO projects (e.g., PowerPoint, Canva, Google Drive, Notion).

### 2. Create an Engaging Slideshow Presentation

Following the workshop showcase, the recruit will be required to create and deliver a short presentation on a topic of their choice.  
The **Awareness and Outreach Manager** will determine the allocated time for this practice presentation, depending on schedule and context.

The presentation must demonstrate one or more of the following:

- Effective use of morph transitions
- Use of 3D objects
- Hand-drawn or sketch elements
- Any other creative PowerPoint technique that enhances clarity and engagement

This will assess their creativity, tool proficiency, and ability to communicate effectively.

### 3. Engage with an Outreach Team Member

- Schedule a short conversation with a member of the Outreach team.
- Ask and answer questions to test understanding of technical concepts covered in AO workshops.
- This promotes cross-team collaboration and ensures the member can support or co-deliver content.

## Phase 3: Project Assignment and Accountability

### 1. Assign to a Current AO Project

- Once foundational skills are demonstrated, assign the member to a live project.
- Define specific tasks and timelines (e.g., draft ethical case study slides, design a social media post, assist with event coordination).

### 2. Demonstrate Independent Working Capability

The member must be able to:

- Complete their assigned tasks within the allocated time frame (with a short grace period, if necessary).
- Communicate any delays or issues clearly and proactively.
- Work independently without placing unnecessary stress on other members.

## Phase 4: Leadership and Ownership

### 1. Initiate and Lead a New Project

After proving reliability and competence, the member is expected to:

- Propose a new idea or project aligned with the goals of the AO subcommittee.
- Take ownership of its development and execution with mentorship from a senior member.
- Reflect on outcomes and document lessons learned to inform future work.
