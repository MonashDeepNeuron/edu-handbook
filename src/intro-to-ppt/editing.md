# Editing

Since all PowerPoints are shared using OneDrive, when you initially click the link to the PowerPoint, you will be taken to the **web app** version of the presentation.

**AVOID** editing using the web app since it tends to be buggy and can lead to issues further down the road. 

Instead, you want to edit using the PowerPoint desktop app, which is more powerful and robust (less buggy).

Your browser will then prompt you to open the presentation using your desktop PowerPoint application. 
Select 'Open Microsoft Powerpoint.app' or the respective button in your machine.

Your device will now open the presentation on the actual PowerPoint desktop application. Do all your editing here.
