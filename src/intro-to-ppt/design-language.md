# Design Language

Design language is the set of visual elements, principles, and rules that define a PowerPoint's look and feel (within the context of workshops).

It it crucial that all PowerPoints have a <ins>consistent</ins> design language (unless the nature of the workshop requires otherwise) as this helps us make the presentation more aesthetic.

Fortunately, as an MDN member, there is not much work required from your end since our Marketing team has already made an [**MDN Brand Guide (Figma)**](https://www.figma.com/design/iKeXPDst2rOSixPH4cdOFY/MDN-Brand-Kit)
