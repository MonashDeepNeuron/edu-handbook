# Speech

The greatest scholar in the world is the worst presenter if they cannot effectively communicate content to an audience.

Always speak using language that students are familiar with and use simple terms where you can. 

If you need to use jargon or technical language, make sure you explain it properly to the students and check they understand before moving on.

Counterintuitively, despite being in a technical team, it is a poor habit to speak very technically, using acronyms and jargon. Get in the habit of explaining things simply.
