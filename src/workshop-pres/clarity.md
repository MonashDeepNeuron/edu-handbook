# Clarity

Clarity is essential for ensuring your audience can follow along and understand the key messages of your workshop. This means breaking down complex ideas into digestible parts, avoiding unnecessary jargon, and speaking with purpose. Even the best content loses impact if it isn’t communicated clearly.

- Use simple, direct language to explain concepts
- Break information into chunks and summarise regularly
- Check for understanding (e.g., “Does that make sense so far?”)
- Avoid filler words or rambling
- Highlight key takeaways visually and verbally
