# Mannerisms

Mannerisms are repeated physical behaviours made by a presenter. 

They can either be helpful or distracting, depending on how they are used. 

Everyone has mannerisms which occur when they are talking to an individual or presenting information to a group. 

You should pay attention to any mannerisms you have, and whether they harm or hurt the overall presentation. 

A presenter should develop mannerisms that help their instructional technique and learn to avoid mannerisms that are annoying or distracting. 

Some examples of mannerisms:

* Swaying excessively when moving (likely distracting)
* Fidgeting (likely distracting)
* Use of hand gestures (likely productive)
* Strong eye contact (likely productive)

## Eye contact
**Eye contact** is by far the MOST IMPORTANT mannerism.

Eye contact can be used productively in the classroom by ensuring eye contact with every member of the group throughout the lesson. There is plenty of research to back that this improves interest, engagement and overall learning outcomes. 

If you are currently scared of eye contact, it is crucial you overcome this fear to be an effective Education member. Poor eye contact can significantly hamper the quality of a workshop as culturally, it signals that you no longer want to continue communicating and desire some distance.
