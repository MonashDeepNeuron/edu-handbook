# Workshop Presentation

Most of us have some intuition of what to do when we're actually presenting.

But we rarely consider precisely what we should concentrate on when we're in the real time process of presenting.

Through our experience, we narrowed down the most important components of delivering a successful presentation.

Our hope is you think about these considerations prior to the workshop, such that you're able to flesh out deliberate strategies for how you could implement them during your actual presentation.
