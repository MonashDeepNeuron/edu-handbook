# Adaptability

You should go into a workshop with the mindset that everything that could go wrong, will go wrong. 

By planning for worst case scenarios, you’re more adaptable.

Things go wrong all the time- slides don’t work, audience isn’t participating.

Knowing how to manage these situations is key.

Some of our best workshops have risen as a consequence of something going wrong and us saving it.
