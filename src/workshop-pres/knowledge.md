# Knowledge

You should know the subject youâ€™re presenting about thoroughly, particularly if you expect the audience to have learned something by the end of your workshop. 

This includes not just the material covered, but also to be able to answer any questions you might be asked.

This is why MDN Edu Members are expected to meet technical requirements (link) before the end of their probation period.

You can ask your manager/s for help or consult MDN resources.
