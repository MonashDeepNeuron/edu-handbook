# Control

This is more pertinent within a high school workshop context. 

Certain high schools may have problematic students in the classroom or may be rowdy due to other variables (last period on a friday, right before lunch etc)

Students are unlikely to listen to instructors that donâ€™t keep consistent standards.  

At the beginning of lessons, it helps to clearly communicate simple expectations throughout the workshop (eg: hands up to ask questions).

As a presenter, you must set the standards and ensure that those standards are met.
