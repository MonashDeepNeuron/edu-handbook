# Questioning

Asking questions throughout the workshop is the best way to see if the audience is engaged and if your explanations are clear. 

A good workshop is a two way process where the audience is engaged with the content and participates actively.

Ensure that throughout the workshop, you are consistently asking questions to gauge interest and increase engagement. 

Additionally, during activities, make sure you walk around groups and question them on how they completed the activity, what they learned from the activity etc.

Use the 4 Pâ€™s Framework when asking questions:

```admonish info title="4 P's Framework"
<h1 style="color: white;">Pose</h1>

Ask the question to the audience. Ensure everyone hears.
<h1 style="color: white;">Pause</h1>

    
Give the audience time to think. Generally 3-5 seconds.
<h1 style="color: white;">Pounce</h1>

    
Select someone from the audience to answer the question. 
    
When the audience is apprehensive and no one has volunteered, pick out a member and ask them the question directly. Remember to have strong eye contact when picking out this individual and to avoid pointing at them with a finger (considered rude in some cultures).

<h1 style="color: white;">Praise</h1>
Regardless of the answer, praise the volunteer/selected member for participating. 

```

Questions can also be extremely powerful in managing students who are distracting the overall focus/vibe of the class.

When you identify a distracted student, rather than asking them to be silent (which usually has a terrible likelihood of working), it's much more effective to direct a question towards them.

This calls them out directly, forcing them to focus on the class, and if they get the answer wrong (which they likely do), the social embarrassment will likely improve the chance they focus on the content you're delivering. 

```admonish info title="PR Framework for Managing Distracted Students"
<h1 style="color: white;">Pounce</h1>

Select the distracted from the audience to answer the question. 
    
Remember to have strong eye contact when picking out this individual and to avoid pointing at them with a finger (considered rude in some cultures).

<h1 style="color: white;">Redirect</h1>
When they likely get the answer wrong, redirect the question into an open question towards the class and use the 4 P's to get an answer. 

You may have to use PR multiple times on the distracted student until they stop being disruptive.
