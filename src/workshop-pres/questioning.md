# Questioning

Asking questions throughout the workshop is the best way to see if the audience is engaged and if your explanations are clear. 

A good workshop is a two way process where the audience is engaged with the content and participates actively.

Ensure that throughout the workshop, you are consistently asking questions to gauge interest and increase engagement. 

Additionally, during activities, make sure you walk around groups and question them on how they completed the activity, what they learned from the activity etc.

Use the 4 Pâ€™s Framework when asking questions:
##  Pose

Ask the question to the audience. Ensure everyone hears.
##  Pause
    
Give the audience time to think. Generally 3-5 seconds.
##  Pounce
    
Select someone from the audience to answer the question. 
    
When the audience is apprehensive and no one has volunteered, pick out a member and ask them the question directly. Remember to have strong eye contact when picking out this individual and to avoid pointing at them with a finger (considered rude in some cultures).
##  Praise
    
Regardless of the answer, praise the volunteer/selected member for participating.
