# Attitude

Always remain positive in your approach to any presentation. 

This sounds really corny I know, but it's often underrated.

There is nothing worse than being at a presentation that the presenter doesn't even want to be at. 

Poor attitude from a presenter significantly detriments the overall feeling of a workshop. 

Whenever a participant gives a response that is correct, offer genuine praise and encouragement. Contrarily, if a participant gets one wrong, avoid undermining or dismissing them and rather, helpfully correct them. 

Place yourself in the audienceâ€™s shoes and treat them in the manner you would like to be treated.
