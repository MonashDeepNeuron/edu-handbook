As touched on in the workshop preparation, the Speaker plays a significant role in the overall quality of the workshop.

In fact, Dr Shaun Kemp (UMelb) cited that in all the research he worked on, the strongest variable influencing a student’s interest in a subject was the student’s perception of the teacher. 

You should allow your personality to naturally flow through the workshop- as if you were presenting it to your friends.

Appearance also ties into this.

If you appear untidy, disorganised or slouch around, it’s unreasonable to expect the audience to be different.
