# Framing

Framing is about how you introduce and position what youâ€™re about to say so that your audience is primed to understand or engage with it in the intended way. It's especially important when discussing complex, controversial, or abstract topics. The right framing can make the difference between confusion and clarity, or defensiveness and curiosity.

- Start with a relatable hook, question, or real-world example
- Set context before jumping into details
- Acknowledge different perspectives when discussing ethical/legal issues
- Use softening language when raising challenging or sensitive points
