# Voice

Your voice is an underrated tool to leverage when presenting.

Tone, pitch, speed, and volume can all be altered to ensure engagement or enhance meaning. 

Always try to vary the pitch and volume of your voice, but don't sing. 

A monotone voice will send the audience to sleep.

Try avoid talking too fast or slow.
