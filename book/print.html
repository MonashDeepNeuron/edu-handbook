<h1 id="welcome"><a class="header" href="#welcome">Welcome</a></h1>
<p>Welcome and congratulations on joining the MDN Education team.</p>
<p>This is the Education Training Book which contains the training material which covers much of the prerequisite content necessary to deliver workshops or provide education as part of MDN.</p>
<p>Throughout this book you will learn the philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of education at MDN, alongside the specific tools and strategies we use.</p>
<p>Have fun 😋</p>
<h2 id="what-is-education-at-monash-deepneuron"><a class="header" href="#what-is-education-at-monash-deepneuron">What is Education at Monash DeepNeuron?</a></h2>
<p>The Education Branch in MDN aims to raise awareness and generate excitement within young minds so that they may establish a more informed insight into the world of DL and HPC.</p>
<p>This can involve things such as running workshops, holding events, crafting resources and creating content.</p>
<p>Within Education, you'll learn how to clearly articulate technical concepts relating to AI and HPC, alongside the tangential skills necessary to do so in an engaging, exciting way.</p>
<h2 id="education-training"><a class="header" href="#education-training">Education Training</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-is-all-this-and-what-is-it-for"><a class="header" href="#what-is-all-this-and-what-is-it-for">What is all this and what is it for?</a></h3>
<p>This is a book. More specifically it is the book containing all the content, training resources and learning materials that you will be using to complete your Edu training.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to provide clear and concise learning resources that you can utilise effectively; not just in your role at Education, but for the entirety of your time at Monash DeepNeuron and beyond.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-you-going-to-learn"><a class="header" href="#what-are-you-going-to-learn">What are you going to learn?</a></h3>
<p>During your Education training, you are going to learn key Education concepts and various tools that exist that allow us to conduct our operations as Education at MDN.</p>
<p>You will begin by learning about the philosophy behind our educational approach at MDN.</p>
<p>From here, you will go through the setup process for MDN Edu members, covering admin, expectations the subsequent induction procedures.</p>
<p>You'll then jump into the concepts involved in an MDN workshop- from the theory to the tactical frameworks.</p>
<p>Lastly, you'll learn how to effectively utilise key technologies used for our presentations, events and resources, such as PowerPoint and Google Colab.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-this-book">How to use this book</a></h3>
<p>The structure of this booklet has been developed to allow you to learn at your own pace.</p>
<p>The content is split up into chapters which covers a particular topic which can be further broken down sections.</p>
<p>You navigate through the book mostly chronologically using the arrow buttons on either side of the page (can't miss them).</p>
<p>You can also look through the chapters and sections to find particular topics or using the search bar, which can be activated by typing <kbd>S</kbd>.</p>
<!-- Potentially add challenges later on??? 
Each chapter has a challenges section. These contain various tasks to complete related to the content of each chapter.
-->

<p>For every workshop you present with us, there will be three types of members in your audience:</p>
<p>For each of these archetypes, here are our goals:</p>
<p><img src="workshop-prep/src/audiencee.png" alt="THis is an aim" /></p>
<p>Different workshops will have different ratios of Nyans, Nikhils and Tylers:</p>
<p>You’ll have to tailor your workshops to appeal to the dominant archetype/s you presume will be there on the day.</p>
<pre><code>If you have a lot of Nikhils, you want to go technically deeper, making sure you stimulate them intellectually. 

Conversely, if you have a classroom of Tylers, your pure focus should be keeping them engaged.
</code></pre>
<p>The degree to which they’re engaged depends entirely on your judgement of which archetype dominates your audience as they should guide the scope and actual content, which will be covered later.</p>
<p>Most presenters focus on the specific workshop stuff.
(oHHhhHhh My god WHaT Font ShOuld i uSE FOr my 5 sliDe powERPoInT guYs 🤓 )</p>
<p>You should spend some time thinking about the audience.</p>
<p>The spread of archetypes determines the success of whatever you present/create.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="questioning"><a class="header" href="#questioning">Questioning</a></h1>
<p>Asking questions throughout the workshop is the best way to see if the audience is engaged and if your explanations are clear.</p>
<p>A good workshop is a two way process where the audience is engaged with the content and participates actively.</p>
<p>Ensure that throughout the workshop, you are consistently asking questions to gauge interest and increase engagement.</p>
<p>Additionally, during activities, make sure you walk around groups and question them on how they completed the activity, what they learned from the activity etc.</p>
<p>Use the 4 P’s Framework when asking questions:</p>
<h2 id="pose"><a class="header" href="#pose">Pose</a></h2>
<p>Ask the question to the audience. Ensure everyone hears.</p>
<h2 id="pause"><a class="header" href="#pause">Pause</a></h2>
<p>Give the audience time to think. Generally 3-5 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="pounce"><a class="header" href="#pounce">Pounce</a></h2>
<p>Select someone from the audience to answer the question.</p>
<p>When the audience is apprehensive and no one has volunteered, pick out a member and ask them the question directly. Remember to have strong eye contact when picking out this individual and to avoid pointing at them with a finger (considered rude in some cultures).</p>
<h2 id="praise"><a class="header" href="#praise">Praise</a></h2>
<p>Regardless of the answer, praise the volunteer/selected member for participating.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aidsprops"><a class="header" href="#aidsprops">Aids/Props</a></h1>
<p>The use of physical teaching aids/props can either be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deciding factor that sets apart your workshop from anything else the audience has ever seen</li>
<li>The downfall of your workshop</li>
</ul>
<p>They're a double edged sword.</p>
<p>A lot of student teams fall into the trap of having a physical prop/item they display and talk about during their presentation. This prop ends up being central to the actual workshop.</p>
<p>This is really boring.</p>
<p>We believe a prop should NEVER be the central focus of any workshop you present. It's simply too easy to get bored of it quick.</p>
<p>We instead believe that props should:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide an example or illustrate what is already included in the presentation</p>
<p>For example, when giving a workshop on HPC, a quick demonstration (we're talking &lt;3 mins) of the HPC mini cluster (6 raspberry pi's 4 SBCs combined at time or writing)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a pattern interrupt</p>
<p>For example, if talking about whether the audience would trust AI with their life for an L&amp;E workshop, pointing nerf guns at the audience to illustrate the concept.</p>
<p>These can be <strong>extremely</strong> powerful in increasing engagement, but be careful to make sure they're not too distracting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Props are not limited to physical things.</p>
<p>Digital aids can also be used similarly.</p>
<p>For example, when talking about generative AI, an example of an actual GAN generating an image live during the presentation would stand out and reinforce the concept.</p>
<p>This is part of why MDN Edu Members are expected to work on projects- so they're able to showcase cool applications of AI/HPC/L&amp;E whilst presenting.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="speech"><a class="header" href="#speech">Speech</a></h1>
<p>The greatest scholar in the world is the worst presenter if they cannot effectively communicate content to an audience.</p>
<p>Always speak using language that students are familiar with and use simple terms where you can.</p>
<p>If you need to use jargon or technical language, make sure you explain it properly to the students and check they understand before moving on.</p>
<p>Counterintuitively, despite being in a technical team, it is a poor habit to speak very technically, using acronyms and jargon. Get in the habit of explaining things simply.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mannerisms"><a class="header" href="#mannerisms">Mannerisms</a></h1>
<p>Mannerisms are repeated physical behaviours made by a presenter.</p>
<p>They can either be helpful or distracting, depending on how they are used.</p>
<p>Everyone has mannerisms which occur when they are talking to an individual or presenting information to a group.</p>
<p>You should pay attention to any mannerisms you have, and whether they harm or hurt the overall presentation.</p>
<p>A presenter should develop mannerisms that help their instructional technique and learn to avoid mannerisms that are annoying or distracting.</p>
<p>Some examples of mannerisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swaying excessively when moving (likely distracting)</li>
<li>Fidgeting (likely distracting)</li>
<li>Use of hand gestures (likely productive)</li>
<li>Strong eye contact (likely productive)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="eye-contact"><a class="header" href="#eye-contact">Eye contact</a></h2>
<p><strong>Eye contact</strong> is by far the MOST IMPORTANT mannerism.</p>
<p>Eye contact can be used productively in the classroom by ensuring eye contact with every member of the group throughout the lesson. There is plenty of research to back that this improves interest, engagement and overall learning outcomes.</p>
<p>If you are currently scared of eye contact, it is crucial you overcome this fear to be an effective Education member. Poor eye contact can significantly hamper the quality of a workshop as culturally, it signals that you no longer want to continue communicating and desire some distance. Your manager/s and team members at MDN are there if you need help, alongside online resources.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="attitude"><a class="header" href="#attitude">Attitude</a></h1>
<p>Always remain positive in your approach to any presentation.</p>
<p>This sounds really corny I know, but it's often underrated.</p>
<p>There is nothing worse than being at a presentation that the presenter doesn't even want to be at.</p>
<p>Poor attitude from a presenter significantly detriments the overall feeling of a workshop.</p>
<p>Whenever a participant gives a response that is correct, offer genuine praise and encouragement. Contrarily, if a participant gets one wrong, avoid undermining or dismissing them and rather, helpfully correct them.</p>
<p>Place yourself in the audience’s shoes and treat them in the manner you would like to be treated.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="voice"><a class="header" href="#voice">Voice</a></h1>
<p>Your voice is an underrated tool to leverage when presenting.</p>
<p>Tone, pitch, speed, and volume can all be altered to ensure engagement or enhance meaning.</p>
<p>Always try to vary the pitch and volume of your voice, but don't sing.</p>
<p>A monotone voice will send the audience to sleep.</p>
<p>Try avoid talking too fast or slow.</p>

<p>As touched on in the workshop preparation, the Speaker plays a significant role in the overall quality of the workshop.</p>
<p>In fact, Dr Shaun Kemp (UMelb) cited that in all the research he worked on, the strongest variable influencing a student’s interest in a subject was the student’s perception of the teacher.</p>
<p>You should allow your personality to naturally flow through the workshop- as if you were presenting it to your friends.</p>
<p>Appearance also ties into this.</p>
<p>If you appear untidy, disorganised or slouch around, it’s unreasonable to expect the audience to be different.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="control"><a class="header" href="#control">Control</a></h1>
<p>This is more pertinent within a high school workshop context.</p>
<p>Certain high schools may have problematic students in the classroom or may be rowdy due to other variables (last period on a friday, right before lunch etc)</p>
<p>Students are unlikely to listen to instructors that don’t keep consistent standards.</p>
<p>At the beginning of lessons, it helps to clearly communicate simple expectations throughout the workshop (eg: hands up to ask questions).</p>
<p>As a presenter, you must set the standards and ensure that those standards are met.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="knowledge"><a class="header" href="#knowledge">Knowledge</a></h1>
<p>You should know the subject you’re presenting about thoroughly, particularly if you expect the audience to have learned something by the end of your workshop.</p>
<p>This includes not just the material covered, but also to be able to answer any questions you might be asked.</p>
<p>This is why MDN Edu Members are expected to meet technical requirements (link) before the end of their probation period.</p>
<p>You can ask your manager/s for help or consult MDN resources.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="adaptability"><a class="header" href="#adaptability">Adaptability</a></h1>
<p>You should go into a workshop with the mindset that everything that could go wrong, will go wrong.</p>
<p>By planning for worst case scenarios, you’re more adaptable.</p>
<p>Things go wrong all the time- slides don’t work, audience isn’t participating.</p>
<p>Knowing how to manage these situations is key.</p>
<p>Some of our best workshops have risen as a consequence of something going wrong and us saving it.</p>
